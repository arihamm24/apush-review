          <p id="pg-descr">For each Period, we've taken the time to curate timelines with major events, historical connections (CCOT, causation, comparison) where relevant, important figures, and related vocaulary. Note that historical connections are written as questions you should be able to answer or explain. If you feel you have trouble, mark those questions for review. These tools could be used for connecting events in contextualization, connecting events/evidence in the LEQ, outside evidence in the DBQ, or specific answers on the SAQs, all of which are great strategies to ace the AP Exam</p>
