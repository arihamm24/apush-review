You are required to answer the first two questions and can choose one of the remaining two to answer for a total of 3 SAQs. According to College Board, the question format is as follows:
</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Question 1 is required</strong>, includes 1â€“2 secondary sources, between the years 1754 and 1980.

</li>
                    <li>Students choose between <strong>Question 3 (1491 - 1877)</strong> and <strong>Question 4 (1865 - 2001)<s/trong> for the last question. No sources are included for either Question 3 or Question 4.

                <h2>DBQ</h2>
                <p id="descr">The <strong>Document-Based Question (DBQ)</strong> id the first part of the essay section on the AP Exam. You will be given <strong>7 historical documents</strong> from any time period from 1754 to 1980. These can be primary (speeches, articles, photos, or political cartoons created during the period) or secondary (historians explaining/reflecting on the events/themes in question). You must <strong>use at least 6</strong> of these documents to support your thesis, and for at least 4, you must also connect the <strong>historical context, audience, point of view, and/or purpose (HAPP)</strong> of the document to your argument (This is called "sourcing"). You also receive a point for the use of <strong>outside evidence</strong>, which should be from memory. It is recommended that you take 1 hour to complete the DBQ to try to meet all of the points on the <a href="https://www.antiochschools.net/site/handlers/filedownload.ashx?moduleinstanceid=41110&dataid=40727&FileName=AP%20DBQ%20Rubric.pdf">rubric.</a></p>

Choose the prompt you feel the most confident about. You will respond to the historical prompt by writing and defending your thesis statement. Though the LEQ is the lowest-weighted portion of the exam, it is important to demonstrate your understanding and application of history to the best of your ability and strive for all 6 points on the r<a href="http://www.sultztonianinstitute.com/uploads/7/8/5/5/7855396/leq-rubric.pdf">rubric.</a> </p>
