        <p id="descr">If you've made it this far in APUSH, you are almost definitely familiar with Heimler's History. Though Heimler provides comprehensive and concise explanations of content and components of the AP Exam, some learners may want a longer or slower analysis of content, more specific review, or an extra edge for outside evidence on a DBQ. Here, we've provided some of our favorite history YouTubers for the auditory learners, late-night crammers, and overager reviewers.</p>
