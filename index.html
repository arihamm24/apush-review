            <h3 id="home">How to Use this Site</h3>
            <div id="extra">
                <p>The key to studying for AP US History is <strong>not to get overwhelmed</strong>. This site has a <em>lot</em> of content, and we advise you to take things slowly and spread your studying to maximize sucess. We reccomend the uses below to guide your exam prep</p>
                <div id="extra">
                    <p id="pg-descr">Vocab: Review and connect events, policies, concepts, etc. This will help you know how to relate different periods, contextualize, and compare </p>
                    <p id="pg-descr">Timelines: Answer historical connection question. The exact order of things may not be very useful, but you should know a general order of events and be able to use the events to make comparisons, argue causations, and support changes or continuities</p>
                    <p id="pg-descr">Writing Tips: Learn structure and rubrics. Though you want to aim for accurate use of content, knowing how to structure your written responses and how CollegeBoard wants your responses to look can be immensely helpful </p>
                    <p id="pg-descr">Video Reccomendations: Guided content review! The videos we reccomend go through content by period and explain connections, causes and effects, and encourage historical thinking skills. They are also helpful tools for auditory/visual learners</p>
                    <p id="pg-descr">Additional Content: Collaboration, external resources, outside interpretations. Though history is objective, we are a student-run site, meaning we are as accurate as possible, but lack teaching or grading experience to concretely direct studying. We have therefore provided other resources from educators, other student collaborations, and expert review services to supplement our site</p>
